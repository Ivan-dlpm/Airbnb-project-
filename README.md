<h1> Tableau Dashboard for Multi-Dataset Rental Market Analysis </h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this project, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze short-term rental market trends. I imported and joined multiple datasets to create a unified data source, then developed visualizations that explore key metrics such as top ZIP-code locations, annual revenue patterns, average price by bedroom count, and competitor distribution across property types. I also resolved mapping-related issues by adjusting Tableau’s geographic settings to correctly display ZIP-code boundaries. The final dashboard provides a clear, user-friendly interface that helps users understand how rental prices and occupancy vary by location and property characteristics.
